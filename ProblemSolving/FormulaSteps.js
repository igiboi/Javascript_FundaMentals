THE 7-STEP FORMULA FOR WRITING CODE FROM SCRATCH
================================================================================
Use this EVERY time you see a problem. Make it automatic.

STEP 1: RESTATE THE PROBLEM
- Ask: "What am I actually being asked to do?"
- Write it in your own simple words
- Example: "I need to print every number from start to end"

STEP 2: IDENTIFY INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
- Ask: "What goes in? What comes out?"
- Write it down:
  // Input: start (number), end (number)
  // Output: prints numbers to console

STEP 3: WALK THROUGH A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
- Ask: "If I did this by hand, what steps would I take?"
- Example: printRange(3, 6)
  Step 1: Print 3
  Step 2: Print 4
  Step 3: Print 5
  Step 4: Print 6
  Step 5: Stop

STEP 4: IDENTIFY THE PATTERN
- Ask: "What pattern does this match?"
- Common patterns:
  🔁 Need to repeat? → Loop
  ✅ Need to decide? → Conditional (if/else)
  📦 Working with list? → Array + Loop
  🎯 Building result? → Accumulator
  🔍 Looking for item? → Find pattern
  🧹 Keep some items? → Filter pattern
  🔄 Change each item? → Transform pattern

STEP 5: WRITE PSEUDOCODE (Plain English)
- Ask: "What are the exact steps?"
- Example:
  Start at 'start'
  Keep going until 'end'
  For each number:
    - Print it
    - Move to next

STEP 6: TRANSLATE TO CODE (One line at a time)
- Take each pseudocode line and write JavaScript
- Don't write everything at once
- Build incrementally

STEP 7: TEST AND DEBUG
- Run with the examples
- Try edge cases
- If broken, add console.log() to see what's happening

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE:
1. RESTATE: What am I being asked to do?
2. INPUTS/OUTPUTS: What goes in? What comes out?
3. EXAMPLE: Walk through it by hand
4. PATTERN: Which pattern does this match?
5. PSEUDOCODE: Write steps in plain English
6. CODE: Translate to JavaScript (one line at a time)
7. TEST: Does it work? Try edge cases
