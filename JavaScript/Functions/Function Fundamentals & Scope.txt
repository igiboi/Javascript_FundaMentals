Day 1: Function Fundamentals & Scope
Concepts to understand:

Function declarations vs expressions vs arrow functions (and when each matters)
Scope chain - how JavaScript looks up variables
Lexical scope - where a function is defined determines what it can access


Day 2: Closures (This is HUGE for interviews)
The concept: A closure is when a function "remembers" variables from where it was created, even after that outer function has finished.
Why it matters: Closures power React hooks, event handlers, private variables, and show up in almost every interview.

Day 3: Higher-Order Functions
The concept: Functions that take other functions as arguments OR return functions.
This is your bread and butter - map, filter, reduce are all higher-order functions.
  

Day 4: Callbacks & Function Composition


Day 5: The this Keyword (Interview Killer)


Day 6 & 7: Build Something Real
Project: Create a Task Manager (no frameworks)
Build functions that:

Add tasks with closures to keep IDs private
Filter tasks (completed/incomplete) using higher-order functions
Create task factories that return task objects with methods
Use callbacks for task notifications
