## CRITICAL "UNDER THE HOOD" CONCEPTS
### *Master these and you'll understand how JavaScript really works*

1. **Execution Context & Call Stack**
   - How code actually runs
   - Creation phase vs execution phase

2. **Scope & Closures**
   - Lexical environment
   - Scope chain
   - How closures capture variables

3. **Event Loop**
   - Call stack, callback queue, microtask queue
   - Why `setTimeout(fn, 0)` doesn't run immediately
   - Promises vs callbacks in event loop

4. **Prototypes**
   - Every object has `__proto__`
   - How inheritance really works
   - Why methods should be on prototype

5. **`this` Binding**
   - 4 binding rules (implicit, explicit, new, default)
   - Arrow functions don't have `this`

6. **Memory Management**
   - Garbage collection
   - Memory leaks (event listeners, closures, timers)

7. **Type Coercion**
   - How `==` works under the hood
   - ToNumber, ToString, ToBoolean

## THE SECRET FORMULA

**Understanding (40%)** → Read, watch, take notes  
**Building (40%)** → Write code, break things, fix things  
**Explaining (20%)** → Teach others, write blogs, mock interviews

Most people only do the first. Great developers do all three.

---

**START TOMORROW:**
Week 1, Day 1 - Even if you know closures, review the scope chain. Build everything on a rock-solid foundation.

Which concept are you most excited (or nervous) to learn?
